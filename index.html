            <h3>Information about me</h3>
            I want to be professional programeer. In early years old I was fond of computer science, solved many
            examples on Pascal. But as soon as I ended school, I was stopped getting involved in programming, because
            entered the university, the faculty of engineering(non-programming). And now, I want to return in early
            years and show everyone that I can become a great specialist. I was completed some courses of HTML, CSS, a
            little bit JS (paid courses HTMLacademy, freecodecamp, Grasshopper). But I need to understand how to use
            this knowledge. A couple of years ago I could add that I know Pascal, but now I can't write the first line.
            And I know some designer's programm: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, CorelDraw, a little bit Adobe After
            Effects and Cinema 4D.

            <h3>Work experience</h3>
            As I wrote above, I attended some webinars, YouTube channels and interactive courses. For me, this is the first
            step to my dream. Although also in school I had a website on Ucoz, on which I changed color palette,
            content, added different applications (but now I donâ€™t remember what they were written on).
